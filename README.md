This is a LinkedIn Clone, that I have made with [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

## Getting Started

Demo can be found [here]()

Authentication is provided by Firebase, you may use your email for signup.

## How to use

To start with, you may provide your photo URL (or any, for that matter) during registration. Your profile photo and name will be displayed onto the main screen, which includes the feed.

The post update is real-time based on Firebase, hence it is extremely swift to see the update in the Feeds section.
